Project Title: "Classifying Tumor Malignancy with Deep Learning"

Overview: This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to predict the malignancy of a tumor based on medical imaging data. The Breast Cancer Dataset is loaded and preprocessed, and a neural network model is built using TensorFlow to classify the tumors as either benign or malignant. The model is trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss, and the results are visualized to determine its effectiveness in detecting malignancy.

Motivation: Early and accurate detection of cancer is critical for effective treatment, and machine learning algorithms have the potential to aid medical professionals in making more informed diagnoses. By using deep learning to classify tumors, this project aims to demonstrate the potential for AI in the field of medicine and contribute to the development of more advanced medical imaging analysis tools.
