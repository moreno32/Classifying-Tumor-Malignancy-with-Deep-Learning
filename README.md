# Classifying Tumor Malignancy with Deep Learning

## 🔄 Overview:
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to predict the malignancy of a tumor based on medical imaging data. The Breast Cancer Dataset is loaded and preprocessed, and a neural network model is built using TensorFlow to classify the tumors as either benign or malignant. The model is trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and loss, and the results are visualized to determine its effectiveness in detecting malignancy.
